    "Deep Learning is becoming increasingly relevant both in the research and industrial worlds. Thanks to its exceptional ability in solving problems and tasks, Deep Learning is being actively researched and developed to discover and implement new exciting architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most cutting-edge techniques are the so-called ***multimodal models***, which are models that are able to perform on a mixture of data types, for instance text and visual inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task assigned to this project is based on this latter type of multimodal models. By leveraging the capabilities of the ***Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training***, or **CLIP** for short, model by OpenAI the objective was to perform *visual grounding* on the *RefCOCOg* benchmark dataset.\n",
    "\n",

    "# How to run this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook contains: the baseline implementation that we developed; **our model/architecture proposal, at the very end** (\"Deviating CLIP's \"attention\" to relevant parts\" section); all the ideas that we worked on, in between the baseline and our final proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to include the intermediate ideas as they were part of our process and we think some of them may be of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this Notebook, we suggest to run the first part up to the baseline. Then, our results can be checked by jumping to the respective section, as mentioned earlier, and running that.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to run the code in the cells in between, since it is just implementations of some ideas we are proposing.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the results can be found in the tables at the end of every section, therefore it is not strictly necessary to run the Notebook other than to check it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is quite some code. However, we did our best to keep it as simple and understandable as possible. Comments will guide the readers into the details, whereas Markdown cells will drive them across the macro-blocks by providing a more general overview of what is going on in each part of this Notebook.\n",
    "Some code may be repeated for clarity and to ensure that it is consistent across all the sections of this comprehensive Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "### Package installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this Notebook, some additional packages are required. Running the next cell will install them using PIP. We are assuming that PyTorch is already installed and properly configured to work on the machine (since installation may vary depending on hardware and software configurations).\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "### Dataset download\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset will be downloaded from Google Drive, using the shared folder ID and the `gdown` command. However, it may happen that Google Drive does not allow to download the `.tar` folder. This can happen if several downloads of the same file occurred recently and there is nothing we can do to avoid this: it is a Google Drive's policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it does not work, we kindly ask to manually load the dataset from Google Drive rather than downloading it in the environment. While this solves the issue, the implementation would depend on the path of the dataset in one's Google Drive storage, so it is not possible, for us, to handle this directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is then extracted in the `refcocog` folder, which is the one in which the code will look for to load all the data."

    "1. Dataset exploration\n",
    "    * We have thoroughly explored the dataset to understand its structure, how to link information together and what to expect from it\n",
    "1. Baseline implementation\n",
    "    * We have implemented the baseline to understand how it performs and what issues it brings in\n",
    "1. Results examination\n",
    "    * We have looked at several outputs one-by-one to better understand the problems that the baseline was unable to solve\n",
    "1. Brain storming, looking for novel ideas and a lot of reading\n",
    "1. Exploration\n",
    "    * We have implemented and tested many different architectures and pipelines in order to understand what could work and what could not\n",
    "1. Improvement\n",
    "    * Based on the results of the previous step, we have decided to focus on a couple of architectures and did our best, both in terms of reading new papers and creativity, to push them forwards and improve the baseline's results\n",
    "1. Results examination and conclusions\n",

    "* Intersection over Union (IoU), average\n",
    "* Accuracy, computed as the fraction of samples having an Intersection over Union $\\ge 0.5$\n",
    "* Cosine similarity between the embedding of the image cropped on the estimated bounding box and the embedding of the image cropped on the golden/ground truth bounding box, average\n",
    "\n",
    "Other metrics can be computed (e.g. top k accuracy, which looks for a correct result in the top k produced - that is, the k bounding boxes with the highest confidence). However, these can be derived or are strongly correlated to the three we have decided to use for the overall assignment, therefore we chose to compute the three aforementioned metrics on the whole set of examples used for testing."

    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"./asset/regressor-model.png\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes as input the concatenation of the text and image embeddings produced by CLIP. It produces as output a set of coordinates, which represent the top-left and bottom-right points of the bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were expecting for it not to produce good results, but we decided to accurately measure its performance - this is why we implemented it. It was not able to improve on the baseline and we noticed that it usually produces much larger bounding boxes than the ground truth ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it does not include any region-proposal algorithm, thus being faster in estimating a bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained on the full training set for 30 epochs. We utilized the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate of $0.01$ (the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer tended to diverge, thus being unstable). We tried both the IoU loss and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. In either case, we were not able to get satisfactory results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this architecture as a test to understand whether it was possible to solve the task in this simple way. The architecture is a basic bottleneck, which reduces the dimensionality of the input to the first layer at each layer, thus producing a four-value output as expected."

    "## 2. Adding a Fully-Connected Neural Network on top of CLIP\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried adding a fully-connected neural network on top of CLIP. Differently from the previous idea, which reduced the dimensionality at each layer, this one first enlarges it and then shrinks down to only four outputs (as the previous one).\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"./asset/large-regressor-model.png\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This network was larger and we trained similarly to the previous one. We had to use the Mean Squared Error loss as the IoU loss was not stable enough. We also tried to combine it with MSE as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{L} = \\lambda_1 \\textit{MSE} + \\lambda_2 \\textit{IoU}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we set $\\lambda_1 = 0.7$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1.0$. In the end, the best one was MSE alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error, in this specific context, computes the average (squared) error between each pair of coordinates (predicted, ground truth). Therefore, if a bounding box is \"perfect\" (perfect overlap with the ground truth), it will have a MSE of 0. MSE penalizes small errors less than large errors, so it should allow the network to predict somewhat good values even if precision with respect to the ground truth may not be optimal. Nonetheless, MSE is the standard go-to loss function for regression problems, which is how we framed this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intersection over Union focuses instead on maximizing the overlap between the two boxes. If the prediction is (x, y, x, y) (so it is just a line) and the golden truth is (x, y, ..., ...), then MSE would be quite low, since half the points perfectly match those of the ground truth. However, the goal is to make sure the output has an area and that the overlap with the ground truth is as large as possible. Thus, introducing the IoU may halp in serve this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training took approximately one hour when using the pre-computed embeddings. In this Notebook, where they are computed on-demand, it takes a lot longer - up to some hours. Indeed, to optimize computing time, we pre-computed the embeddings of all samples in the dataset and stored it on the file system, so that we could train several networks with different parameters much more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To speed training up, we preprocessed the whole dataset at the beginning by computing the embeddings for both images and textual prompts. Then we stored all those embeddings into a CSV file (approximate size of 1.2 GB for the training set). Eventually, we loaded the whole file containing all the embeddings of the training set into memory, thus cutting off CLIP to focus only on training the neural network. Otherwise, it would have taken much longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this architecture as we started from the one presented in the previous section and we expanded it by introducing also dropout layers, to try and limit overfit. The architecture first projects the input into a larger dimensional space, which is then reduced progressively down to 4 values, as in the previous architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of dropout layers with probability $p = 0.5$ should reduce at least partially the issues encountered with the previous model. Adding more linear layers should instead help in making it possible to learn a better, richer and more complex representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we present the code and architecture of this model. Some elements are shared with the previous architecture, therefore they are not repeated again. To successfully run the following code, then, it is necessary to run the cells in the previous section to get CLIP models loaded, the MultiNetModel architecture defined, etc."

Therefore, spaCy would struggle in dealing with them and more complex models, which introduce an additional overhead other than that of YOLO, would be needed.\n",

    "### 6.2 Deviating CLIP's \"attention\" to relevant parts (our final proposal)\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to try and make CLIP focus on some specific areas of the input image while feeding it all to it in order not to lose spatial information and context: indeed, we believe CLIP has the ability to understand language and, if properly guided, it can be more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we pushed even further the prompt engineering task we had already done for the previously presented architectures. Some key elements factored in into this final pipeline which we present as our project:\n",
    "1. Attention engineering to make CLIP focus on the relevant object in the image. By introducing masking operators and visual annotations (e.g. rectangles, ellipses) and background blurring to reduce distractions, we found that CLIP is able to shift its attention to che highlighted block. Note that \"attention\" does not only refer to the concept of \"attention\" in Transformer-based models: it refers to the general ability to focus and pay attention on a given portion of the image. Our method indeed works well even with ResNet-based models.\n",
    "1. Prompt adapatation to unbalance even more CLIP's focus onto every object proposal. We have tried several textual prompt engineering techniques, for instance:\n",
    "    * `prompt + ' with a {color} {shape} around it`, where: `{color}` was either fixed for all region proposals, independently of their position, or dependant on their position; `{shape}` depends on the shape actually used for highlighting the region proposal and it can be \"rectangle\", \"ellipse\" or \"circle\".\n",
    "    * `This is + prompt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discovered that this idea could work \"by accident\", when, due to a wrong implementation, we drew a rectangle instead of cropping the image on the region proposals. Combined with the aforementioned ideas, we though it would be interesting, so we fully developed it through thorough investigations on the outcomes it produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"./asset/visual-prompting-detail.png\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue is making sure that spatial structure is preserved while not deviating CLIP's attention to the wrong objects. In the beginning, we were only using visual markers to shift CLIP's focus, but it was not enough for overly crowded scenes. Therefore, we decided to smooth things out by blurring the background and keeping the rectangular window around a region proposal sharp. (We also tried other window shapes, for instance ellipses and rounded-corner rectangles, but we found straight rectangles to work the best.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows, as it can be seen in the previous image, to leverage both CLIP's spatial reasoning abilities and natural language understanding capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we found that generating two distinct proposals for each region proposal helps improving the overall performance. More precisely, we tried the following modifications:\n",
    "1. Adding a visual marker\n",
    "2. Adding a visual marker and blurring\n",
    "3. Adding a visual marker and gray-scaling the rest of the image\n",
    "4. Adding a visual marker and gray-scaling and blurring the rest of the image\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, we found that background blurring plays a key role in improving the performance, therefore we decided to only use modifications 2 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This resembles the way our vision system works: we can perceive the whole image, but we can truly focus only on a small region.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, if there are $m$ object proposals, we have to send through CLIP $2 \\times m$ images, corresponding to the augmented prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "After extensive tests, we found the following parameters to work the best:\n",
    "* using a stroke color of red for visual markers;\n",
    "* using a stroke width of 3 px for visual markers;\n",
    "* using a blur radius of 20 px, with a Gaussian blur being applied;\n",
    "* masking using rectangles and using ellipses as visual markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also tried the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "* Stroke color: red, orange, purple, yello, green, blue, none (transparent, to hide it).\n",
    "* Stroke width: 1 to 10 px, with all intermediate integer values.\n",
    "* Blur radius: 0 px (no blur), 1 px, 1.5 px, 2 px, 5 px, 10 px, 20 px, 25 px and 50 px.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing all these hyperparameters combinations is challenging. Considering that there is also the backbone model playing a crucial role and that it could interfere with some settings, we had to try them in a controlled way to understand what combination works the best. Therefore, we sampled approximately 100 samples from the dataset and we tested about fifty distinct combinations on them. We manually examined all the outcomes to understand how the model was behaving. In the end, after all these thorough tests, we decided to use the configuration we proposed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To further improve the performance, we wanted to find a way of discouraging proposals which are unlikely to be the correct ones. We thought of the following two ideas, which we implemented and tested on the whole test test:\n",
    "* Disallowing region proposals whose area is larger than $a\\%$ of the area of the given image. We set $a = 80\\%$, thus prohibiting region proposals spanning at least $80\\%$ of the given image. This is a thoughtful idea as most of the objects referred to by prompts are actually a lot smaller than the overall image they are contained in. At the same time, region proposal algorithms/models (such as the YOLO we are using) sometimes find almos the whole image as a proposal: for instance, if the photo depicts a table with some objects on it, YOLO would also find the whole table, thus generating a proposal that contains almost all the original image and which will likely get the highest score for this reason. This approach may lead to wrong results in some edge cases, when the actual object to be found is (almost) the whole image. Nevertheless, the overall loss due to this fact is negligible considering how rare it is to find such a situation. However, we found this technique not to significantly improve the overall performance, so we decided *not* to leave it in the final proposal. Nevertheless, the lines of code that deas with it can be uncommented to reintroduce it.\n",
    "* Weighting the region proposals by their content. That is, we used the label provided by YOLO (_e.g._ 'person') to create novel prompts (_i.e._, 'A picture of a {category}'), which we will refer to as \"category prompts\". We then encoded all these prompts (80 in total, as the number of categories recognized by YOLO) using the CLIP encoder. When a region was proposed, we weighted it by the similarity between the category prompt and the given prompt. For instance, the prompt \"An orange in the bowl\" will have a higher similarity with the category prompt \"A picture of a orange\" than to \"A picture of a cat\". Therefore, if the image contains both an orange and a cat, the cat region will be assigned a lower likelihood. In this way, we are basically computing a prior probability of a region to be correct one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "All this information has to be combined in order to predict a single bounding box for the given pair (image, prompt). We tried different \"ensembling\" methods, however we found the following to work best:\n",
    "* computing the mean between the cosine similarities of the visual prompts referring to the same proposal. We also tried getting the max or the median (when we tried with 3+ visual prompts for each proposal);\n",
    "* extracting the maximum cosine similarity value across all proposals to find the best-matching one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition we found evidence that CLIP is biased towards certain categories of objects, perhaps because it was exposed more to them during pre-training time. This conjecture/speculation is also supported by some of the papers we have studied. To overcome this issue and gaining some more accuracy, a \"de-biasing\" technique can be applied. This speculation is also supported by some papers, which proposed some techniques to address it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to sample $l$ (in the end, $l = 5000$) random prompts from the trainig set and encoding them using CLIP's encoder. Then, during inference time, we compute the cosine similarity between all region proposals, the given prompt(s) for the image and all these \"de-biasing\" prompts. We therefore get a huge matrix, whose size is $(\\#\\textit{prompts} + \\#\\textit{de-biasing prompts}) \\times \\#\\textit{visual prompts}$. We compute the average on a per-column basis, so we get $\\#\\textit{visual prompts}$ average values. We drop all the rows (corresponding to the prompts) but the first $\\#\\textit{prompts}$ one, which are those referring to the actually given prompts. Then, to each of these remaining rows, we subtract the average computed earlier. This helps de-biasing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up computations, we also tried to pre-compute the value of the de-biasing terms and even to learn them, but it did not to satisfactory results: the best practice, from a mere metric performance result, is achieved by doing as explained above. However, depending on the application, we suggest to take into account the idea of pre-computing these values or to train a network to predict them. In either case - and even in the one we have decided to use - we consider it to be a sort of training: we are exploiting data and information to improve performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, these are the main components of our architecture:\n",
    "* visual prompt editing to guide CLIP towards our goal;\n",
    "* textual prompt editing to help CLIP find better matches;\n",
    "* using prior knowledge to improve the performance on novel, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell contains the code of our implementation. We present a general framework which we then adapated to work both with YOLOv5 and the recently-released YOLOv8."

Indeed, we noticed that in some cases YOLOv5 was *not* able to propose any (meaningful) regions.\n",

We wanted to discover whether this assertion is accurate and how much and we did not want to exacerbate or \"ruin\" CLIP itself: instead, we wanted to leverage its capabilities.\n",
